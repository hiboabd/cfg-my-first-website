  <p>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
  internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
  Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>

  <p2>HTML is cool</p2>

  <p3><br>CSS is cooler</br></p3>

  <p4>JS is the best</p4>

  <h2><i> What do you need to create a website? </i></h2>

  Not much!
  <ol>
    <li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
    <li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
    <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
    <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
  </ol>

  <p5>Follow my progress on github</p5>
